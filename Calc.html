    <h1>Your MT's Instructions</h1>
    <div>Here are some use cases (abilities your project needs to have):

        Your calculator contain's functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by testing them:
        <strong>add, subtract, multiply and divide</strong>.
        <strong>There's a Function Operate</strong> that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers. You just don't see it here,
        it's hidden inside your MT's calculator.
        We used a simple design with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key
        Hope you like the smooth <strong>style of the buttons</strong>, are those shadows on point or not?
        There's also a <strong>display for the calculator</strong>, go ahead and fill it with some dummy numbers and see of it feels.
        There's a <strong>“Clear” and "AllClear"button</strong> .
        You have functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons, they are stored in the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
        <strong>Test the calculator work!</strong>  
        You’ll be able to store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate() on them when the user presses the “=” key.
        You already have the code that can populate the display, so once operate() has been called, it update's the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation.
        This is the hardest part of the project. You need to figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with them. Don’t feel bad if it takes you a while to figure out the logic.
        Gotchas: watch out for these bugs:
        You should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42.
        Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. 
        If you enter a number then an operator and another number that calculation should be displayed if your next input is an operator. The result of the calculation should be used as the first number in your new calculation.
        You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
        Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
        Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
        Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… don’t let it crash your calculator!
        <div style= "color:green">EXTRA CREDIT:</div>  You can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
        <div style= "color:green">EXTRA CREDIT:</div> Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project… but not if it’s UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.
        <div style= "color:green">EXTRA CREDIT: </div>Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
        <div style= "color:green">EXTRA CREDIT:</div> Add <strong>keyboard support!</strong></div>
        <strong></strong><div style= "color:green">NOTE:</div>You can use the Esc. Key to AC and Backspace or just space to backspace!</strong>
